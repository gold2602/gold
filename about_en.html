        <p><strong>'Local Restaurants Map'</strong> was created not just to introduce delicious restaurants, but to foster co-prosperity with small local businesses and revitalize neighborhood commercial areas.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Commitments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentic Information:</strong> We provide genuine restaurant information, meticulously discovered and verified by us, not paid advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Business First:</strong> We prioritize introducing unique local establishments over large franchises.</li>
            <li><strong>Value of Co-existence:</strong> We strive to be a connecting link that helps small business owners with practical consulting and promotional channels, ensuring their value is fully conveyed to consumers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Restaurant information is selected based on our team's strict criteria and reliable reviews from actual visitors. The pins on the map are not just location details, but carry the unique stories and charm of each establishment.</p>
        <p>We respect the hard work and dedication of all business owners and aim to be the bridge that connects their value to consumers.</p>
